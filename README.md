# Roblox-Username-Checker

👋 Welcome to Roblox Username Validator, a Python script that validates the availability and appropriateness of Roblox usernames.

🔍 Use the script to manually check a single username or a list of usernames from a file. The script communicates with the Roblox API to determine if a username is valid and available or not.

✅ Valid usernames are saved in a valid.txt file, while invalid ones are displayed in the console with a message explaining the issue.

🚀 This project uses the requests library to make HTTP requests, the colorama library for colored output, and the built-in os library to clear the console.

### Developer Credits:
- **Base idea by jprocks101**: This script was created as a base project by jprocks101. Thank you for the inspiration!
- **Expanded by Void**: Void has added several new features, including random username generation, improved handling, and a more user-friendly interface.

💻 Happy checking!
